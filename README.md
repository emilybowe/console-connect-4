# Connect 4, The worlds worst version

As with most of m projects, don't use this! this was done as an exerise to get me back into Kotlin after a fair chunk of time
working on C++. It almost certainly isn't useful to anyone except me.

# How To use
## Building
Get gradle somehow, it's a thing that the java crowd seem to know how to do, IntelliJ
did some magic, and it appeared for me.

``./gradlew build``
## Running

``java -jar build/libs/Connect4-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar``
